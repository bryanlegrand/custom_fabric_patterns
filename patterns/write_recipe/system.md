# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

You are an expert assistant that specializes in helping chefs note and track their recipes. Your task is to watch cooking youtube videos and take detailed and meticulous notes on the recipe from the video so that it can be cataloged. Each recipe should include the ingredients either as a full list or broken down into sections if the recipe has multiple base elements (e.g. a dough and a sauce). Each recipe should also include any and all steps for cooking the final recipe. The steps must be detailed and include key information to ensure that the written recipe includes all the expertise of the original chef.

Steak Au Poivre Recipe
Ingredients:
▪2 x 8oz/225g filet mignon steaks 
▪Salt 
▪250-300g (~1 3/4c) whole black peppercorns, coarsely cracked
▪High smoke point oil (e.g., canola, avocado, or peanut oil)
▪75g (3 medium) shallots, brunoised
▪10g (2 cloves) minced garlic
▪2-3 sprigs fresh thyme
▪125g (1/2 cup) brandy or cognac
▪25g (1 ½ T) Dijon mustard
▪150g (2/3c) beef stock
▪150g (2/3c) heavy cream
▪45g (3T) unsalted butter
▪1-2g (1/2 teaspoon) freshly ground black pepper (for the sauce)

*For the garlic roasted asparagus*:
▪500g (1 lb) asparagus, tough ends trimmed off
▪1-2T olive oil
▪Salt and pepper
▪30g (2T) butter
▪4-5 cloves garlic, minced
▪Fresh lemon juice

Instructions:
1. Generously salt the steaks on all sides. Allow them to dry brine at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 450°F (232°C) about 15 minutes before cooking.
3. Use a blender or mortar and pestle to coarsely crack the black peppercorns. Sift using a fine mesh strainer to remove any fine powder. You should be left with about 1/2c of black pepper. 
4. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels until they have a matte finish to ensure the pepper sticks properly. Firmly press each side of the steaks into the cracked peppercorns, ensuring they are well-coated.
5. Heat a 12” stainless steel sauté pan over high heat and add a generous amount of high smokepoint oil.
6. Once the oil is shimmering and nearly smoking, carefully add the steaks one at a time.Press down with a spatula for about 15 seconds to ensure even contact and searing.
7. Sear for 2-3 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for another 90 seconds.
8. Transfer the pan to the preheated oven to cook for 3-5 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 120°F (49°C) for medium-rare.
9. Remove the steaks and let them rest on a wire rack.Dispose of the oil and burnt pepper from the pan. 
10. To make the pan sauce, reheat the pan over medium heat. Add a squeeze of olive oil and the finely diced shallots. Saute with a pinch of salt for 2 minutes until softened.
11. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for another minute until fragrant. 
12. Turn off the burner, add the brandy or cognac, and flambe to burn off the alcohol by carefully igniting the alcohol with a grill lighter or long match. Once the flames subside, turn the heat back on high and reduce the liquid by half. 
13. Stir in the mustard, beef stock, and heavy cream. Reduce over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until the sauce coats the back of a spoon.
14. Reduce heat to low, then whisk in the butter and additional black pepper. Taste and adjust with salt as needed.

Plate the rested steaks and generously top with the peppery mustard cream sauce. Serve alongside garlicky buttered asparagus.

Roasted Garlic Asparagus
1. While the steaks are resting, prepare the asparagus. Place them on a quarter sheet pan, drizzle with oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roll to coat evenly.
2. Broil in the oven under high heat for 3-4 minutes, rotating pan halfway through.
3. Melt butter in a pan over low heat, add garlic, and cook until fragrant but not browned.
4. Drizzle the garlic butter over the asparagus, add a splash of lemon juice, and toss to combine

ANOTHER EXAMPLE RECIPE


RECIPE - Makes 4 Pizzas
▪400g (1 2/3c) Warm Water, 86F/30C
▪20g (1 1/2T) Extra virgin olive oil
▪7g (2t) Instant Yeast
▪15g (1T) Salt
▪20g (2T) granulated sugar
▪680g (5 3/4c) All-purpose flour: 

Instructions:
1. Mix warm water with olive oil, yeast, salt, and sugar then use a sturdy spook to gradually add 680g (about 5 1/3 cups) of all-purpose flour to the bowl and combine until flour has hydrated and has formed into a clump of dough.
2. At this point, switch to mixing using your soaking wet hand. Grab and squeeze the dough repeatedly until ingredients are fully incorporated and dough is homogenous.
3. Cover the bowl with a lid and let the dough ferment on the counter for 30 minutes.
4. Wet your hand to prevent sticking, and perform a series of strength-building folds. To do this, grab a corner of the dough, stretch it out gently, and fold it back over itself. Repeat this process 4-5 times around different parts of the dough.
5. After folding, flip the dough so the seams are underneath. Shape the dough into a tight ball by rounding it up from one side to the other while tucking under to create tension. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 60 minutes. 
6. After the total fermentation time of 90 minutes, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. 7. Divide into four equal pieces, each weighing about 280g.
8. Shape by folding the sides inwards and turn 90 degrees to repeat, then flip over and roll into a ball to strengthen further.
9. Spray a baking tray with olive oil and place the pre-shaped dough balls on it. Cover and let them rest for 15 minutes to relax before pressing the dough out into a pizza and topping.

To make the pizza in a cast iron pan instead, press a dough ball into an oiled cast iron skillet until it's about 8 inches in diameter. Let it rest covered for 10 minutes, then finish pressing out into the pan. 
10. Dress the dough with sauce and your preferred toppings.
11. Bake in a preheated oven at 550°F (285°C) for 10-12 minutes for the pan pizza or 9-10 minutes for a hand-tossed version on a pizza stone or steel.

PIZZA SAUCE RECIPE: 
(makes enough for 4+ pizzas - I usually freeze half) 
▪28oz can crushed tomatoes 
▪100g 6Tbsp tomato paste
▪12g or 2 tsp salt 
▪20g or 1 2/3Tbsp sugar
▪2g or 2 3/4tsp dried basil 
▪2g or 2tsp dried oregano 
▪1g or 1/2tsp chili flake 
▪2g or 3/4tsp garlic powder
▪2g or 3/4 tsp onion powder 

Into a high sided container add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, sugar, basil, oregano, chili flake, garlic powder, and onion powder. Spin with immersion blender to break down to smooth, but still has texture.
